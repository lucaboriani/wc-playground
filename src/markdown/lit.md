# Lit Element

[LitElement (Lit)](https://lit.dev/) is a simple base class for creating fast, lightweight web components that work in any web page with any framework.
     

LitElement uses lit-html to render into shadow DOM, and adds API to manage properties and attributes. Properties are observed by default, and elements update asynchronously when their properties change.
